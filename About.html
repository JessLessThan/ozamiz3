            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Misamis was an Old Spanish town, which existed as far back as the Spanish era and was conquered strangely not by force of arms, but through faith by some Jesuit Missionaries. Though obscure, the origin of the name “Misamis” is believed to have been derived from the Subano word “Kuyamis” which is a variety of coconut. During the years the name persisted as an inference of geographical location and upon the advent of the Spanish settlers. The word “Kuyamis” easily gave way to the more conveniently pronounceable but corrupted word “Misamis”</p>
